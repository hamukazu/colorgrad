# colorgrad
This shows color gradient.

Just open colorgrad.html, and specify
* source color
* destination color, and
* number of the colors to be shown,
then push "submit" to show the list of the colors.

This is all written in HTML and JavaScript, and consequently, doesn't need a web server. However, it should be run in a computer connected to the network because it requires jquery.
